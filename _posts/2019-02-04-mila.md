# A New Adventure

Because I believe in science and in AI, because I beleive everything should be done to fight climate change, climate change sckepticism and that the Machine Learning community should play its part, I decided to join the [Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithm](https://mila.quebec/en).

Supervised by Pr. [Yoshua Bengio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kukA0LcAAAAJ), I currently work on a project using AI to fight climate change (CCAI).
