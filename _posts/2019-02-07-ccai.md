# Join

This **CCAI** project is an inter-disciplinary enterprise aimed at creating compelling and actionnable visuals to engage people into the fight. The hope is that visuals of how neighborhoods and houses would look like depending on the scale and intensity of global warming will help people **visceralize** climate change into acting for real, as widely as possible but mainly macroscopically _i.e._ at the scale of _structures_ like multinational companies and governments.

## We're Hiring

Pr. Bengio's actively looking for

- a **Post-Doc** to work full-time on these issues (required skills include inter-disciplinary project management, GANs and ideally experience with environmental data / modelling).
- **Interns** (any level) (any time) to work on the CCAI project. Depending on your Degree, you're expected to be familiar with Machine Learning problems, ideally GANs and have good coding skills. Software Engineers are also welcome.
