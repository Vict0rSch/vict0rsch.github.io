##### *STATUS : being written, be patient*

Here I'll quickly go over the installation you need to do to run Theano Keras and Tensorflow

## Python

Start with Python and scientific libraries. If you don't, check out  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or this [blog post](https://joernhees.de/blog/2014/02/25/scientific-python-on-mac-os-x-10-9-with-homebrew/) (for Mac users but interesting for everyone).

Regarding Theano, least check the requirements if you have a doubt : <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#requirements>


## Theano
It may seem obvious but do install Theano before Keras and/or Lasagne.

## CUDA
If you have a Nvidia GPU Theano can use it to do much faster computations; be sure to install all Theano's required [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.fr/object/cuda-parallel-computing-fr.html) dependencies. See also "*What is GPU accelerated computing?*" on Nvidia's [website](http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html).

## cuDNN
Once CUDA is installed you need a Deep Learning specific library for your GPU called cuDNN. Go download it there. (you have to register and answer a few questions but no restriction)

Also, a very nice [tutorial](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/07/04/how-to-install-cuda-toolkit-and-cudnn-for-deep-learning/
) (but careful some things aren't up to date and if you're not comfortable with linux these Cuda/cuDNN libraries are going to be painful to install)

### Lasagne
<http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/stable/user/installation.html>

### Keras
Keras can use either Theano or Google's Tensorflow as a processing backend. I have not tried Tensorflow so everything I say might or not be portable to the Tensorflow backend. My feeling is that it is.
