I'm Victor Schmidt. I come from Paris, France and started this blog in Dec 16. Why? Because I was fed up of only using Github's `readme.md` files to explain what I was doing.

To quickly sum up my learning track I went to a French Engineering school (**Ã‰cole polytechnique**) then took a gap year to work at [**Rythm**](https://rythm.co) and travelled from India to Japan for 6 months.
I then pursued an MSc. in Machine Learning at **University College London** (UCL). 

I **now** work as an NLP Data Scientist at the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance fighting financial fraud, as part of the [Public Interest Entrepreneurs program](https://entrepreneur-interet-general.etalab.gouv.fr/defi/2017/09/26/hopkins/).

#### This blog 
Here you'll find:

* [**Tutorials**](http://vict0rsch.github.io/tutorials/) about how to implement Neural Nets with Keras and Lasagne. 
* [**Resources**](http://vict0rsch.github.io/resources/) I find interesting (see top of the page) - (Needs an update, working on it)
* [**Posts**](http://vict0rsch.github.io) to explain issues I ran into and solved, random thoughts or pieces of advice.

Please use the **comments** but don't expect me to solve your problems : having a full-time job and many side projects (such as this blog or [Metada](https://metada.org)) I most probably won't have the time. If I do however, it will be with pleasure!

Don't hesitate on leaving comments, topics you'd like me to go deeper into or new ones I should scratch.

Cheers!
