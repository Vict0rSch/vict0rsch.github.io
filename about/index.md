I'm Victor Schmidt. I come from Paris, France and started this blog in Dec. 16. Why? Because I was fed up of only using Github's `readme.md` files to explain what I was doing.

To quickly sum up my **learning track** I went to a French Engineering school (Ã‰cole polytechnique) then took a gap year to work at [Rythm](https://rythm.co) and travel from India to Japan. Now I'm currently an MSc. student at UCL (Machine Learning).

#### This blog 
Here you'll find tutorials about **how to implement Neural Nets** with Keras and Lasagne. You'll also find **resources**  I find interesting (see top of the page) and **posts** to explain stuff or just let my thoughts get lost.

Please use the **comments** but don't expect me to solve your problems : being a student with side projects (such as this blog) I most probably won't have the time. If I do however it will be with pleasure!

Don't hesitate on leaving comments, topics you'd like me to go deeper into or new ones I should scratch. Just keep in mind I'm no expert ;)

Cheers!
